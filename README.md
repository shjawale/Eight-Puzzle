# Eight Puzzle

I assembled an object-oriented program using Python that can use 3 different heuristics to solve the eight-puzzle. 

The heuristics are: Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* with the Euclidean Distance heuristic. 

The user can choose either a default puzzle or input their own, and then choose which heuristic of the three to use to solve the puzzle.
